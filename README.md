## Description

This application is designed for users to be able to sign up, login, and see various workouts from our database. The workouts page includes 3 sections, 
Push, Pull, and Legs, which each show workouts that a user can use to exercise certain muscle groups.
Most importantly, once a user has signed up they are able to use our Macro Calculator. In the calculator page they are able to put in additional 
user information, including a weight gain/loss/maintenance goal. The calculator uses the user's data to tell them how many calories they must intake per day
in order to reach their goal. 
Once a user is done they can safely logout, if not their session will automatically expire, and they will need to login again.

We hope you find this application useful! Happy training :)
